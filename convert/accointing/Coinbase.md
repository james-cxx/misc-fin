# Coinbase #

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  Coinbase conversion is considered experimental.  Check converted transactions carefully.
**IMPORTANT NOTE:**  The current implementation is limited to the US region, specified as 'us'.

Unlike other input sources, I have not done a full comparison of Accointing's handling of Coinbase via API versus
Coinbase via converted CSV.  Rather, the conversion from a CSV exported from Coinbase to the Accointing template CSV
format was done simply for consistency.

As with other input formats, my use of Coinbase was limited in the types of transactions, so the `to-accointing.py`
script may not handle all cases, may handle some cases incorrectly, or may simply throw an error.  Check converted
transactions carefully.
